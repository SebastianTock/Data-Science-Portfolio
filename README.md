# Data Science Portfolio

This Repository contains all of my Data Science and Analytics projects I have done for academic, self-learning, and hobby purposes. The projects are either written in R (R markdown) or Python (Jupyter Notebook).

## Projects

#### [Email Paser](https://github.com/SebastianTock/Email_Parser/tree/main)

#### [Credit Card Fraud || Dealing with Imbalanced Datasets](https://github.com/SebastianTock/Credit_Card_Fraud/tree/main)

Created 3 Logistic Regression models, one using the imbalanced dataset, the others are using undersampled and oversampled datasets.

* The Imbalanced model, has high test scores of 99.91%, however, the model also has very low recall of 52.22%

* For the **Undersampled Model**:
    * Accuracy score of 96.10%
    * Recall of 94.73%
* For the **Oversampled Model**:
    * Accuracy score of 94.51%
    * Recall of 91.64%

#### [ST2187 Business Analytics, Applied Modelling and Prediction Coursework](https://github.com/SebastianTock/ST2187_Coursework/tree/main)

This project was done as my coursework for my degree in data science. The objective of this is project to disseminate the key findings from the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis I carried out with Tableau.

#### [ST2195 Programming for Data Science Coursework](https://github.com/SebastianTock/ST2195_Coursework)

This project was done as my coursework for my degree in data science. I analysed the Airline on-time data from the 2009 ASA Statistical Computing and Graphics Data Expo. Due to its large size, the analysis was done only on a subset of consecutive years ranging from 2006 to 2007, the analysis is supplemented by the planes-data available together with the data.
